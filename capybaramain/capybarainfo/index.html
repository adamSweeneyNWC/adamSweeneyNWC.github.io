  <p>Capybaras are known to roam in densely forested areas near large bodies of water, as well as tropical rainforests. Predators of the capybara consist of large cats such as pumas and jaguars. Their predators can also contain avian predators such as eagles and vultures. They mostly prey on vegetation and aquatic plant life, along with an assortment of produce. They are mainly known to be aquatic animals, primarily because most of their diet is aquatic vegetation. They stay near these waters to feed their generations and keep their herds prospering.

    <p>Capybaras originally come from South America, particularly in the forests and wetlands of Argentina and Panama. There are two main branches of the species, the classic capybara and the lesser capybara. The former can mainly be found from Venezuela to northern Argentina and along the Amazon River. The lesser capybara can be found in central Panama though northwestern Colombia and Venezuela. Although they originated in South America they can now be found all over the world. One example of this is the viral videos of capybaras relaxing in yuzu baths in Japan.
