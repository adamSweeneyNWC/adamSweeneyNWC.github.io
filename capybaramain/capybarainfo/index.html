  <p>Capybaras are known to roam in densely forested areas near large bodies of water, as well as tropical rainforests. Predators of the capybara consist of large cats such as pumas and jaguars. Their predators can also contain avian predators such as eagles and vultures. They mostly prey on vegetation and aquatic plant life, along with an assortment of produce. They are mainly known to be aquatic animals, primarily because most of their diet is aquatic vegetation. They stay near these waters to feed their generations and keep their herds prospering.
