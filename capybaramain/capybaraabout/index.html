<!-- Adam's introduction -->
        <div class = "flexbox-item">
          <p>Hi, I'm Adam. I was one of the creators of this website. I helped design our main page and about page. One thing that I like about capybaras is that they are nice and peaceful creatures (herbivores).</p>

<!-- Remy's introduction -->
      
      <div class = "flexbox-item">
          <p>Hi I’m Remy. I mainly worked on the style and javascript as well as the information about the capybara's origins and migration. I first started to like capybaras when my friend shared a relaxing video of them resting in a yuzu bath.

<!-- Aaron's introduction -->
      
      <div class = "flexbox-item">
          <p>Hi I’m Aaron. My contribution to the website consisted of the information provided on the info page and the coordination of the hyperlinks in the separate indexes. My first impression of capybaras was introduced to me when my brother came home from school one day singing a song about them.
